# tes3mp_scripts

My tes3mp(0.7-alpha) scripts, most of the readme stuff will be in the top of the script files.


## jcMarketplace
Allows you to set a price on items and sell them, also blocks other people from picking stuff up.

Supposed to be used with kanaHousing.

Usage: see the scriptfile


## loadtxt2esp
Load TXT2ESP4 files into a cell

Usage: type "/loadtxt2esp 'filename'" were filename is the file in mp-stuff/data/txt2esp without the .txt

Example: I've included the default example file from TXT2ESP4 and you should be able to spawn it with "/loadtxt2esp room_source3"

Problems: There are no admin checks so anyone can run the command. Doors dont work


## jsonCellLoader
Load a json file into the current cell.

See the top of the script file for a readme
