# tes3mp_scripts

My tes3mp(0.7-alpha) scripts



## loadtxt2esp
Load TXT2ESP4 files into a cell


Usage: type "/loadtxt2esp 'filename'" were filename is the file in mp-stuff/data/txt2esp without the .txt

Example: I've included the default example file from TXT2ESP4 and you should be able to spawn it with "/loadtxt2esp room_source3"

Problems: There are no admin checks so anyone can run the command. Doors dont work
